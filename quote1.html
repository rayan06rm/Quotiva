                <h2>About the Author</h2>
                <p>Maya Angelou (1928-2014) was an acclaimed American poet, memoirist, and civil rights activist. Best known for her powerful writings on identity, race, and resilience, she became one of the most influential voices of the 20th century. Her autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) was a groundbreaking work, detailing her tumultuous childhood and the impact of racism. Angelouâ€™s poetry, including works such as Still I Rise and Phenomenal Woman, celebrates strength, empowerment, and the human spirit. She was not only an artist but also a passionate advocate for social justice, working alongside figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X during the civil rights movement. Angelou's legacy continues to inspire generations with her wisdom, eloquence, and unwavering commitment to human dignity.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Quote</h2>
            <p><strong>Why did she write this?</strong><br>Maya Angelou wrote this quote to remind us that setbacks and defeats are not the end, but rather a necessary part of the journey. She wanted to convey that even in the face of hardship, we have the strength to rise again. By encountering defeats, we learn more about ourselves, our resilience, and our capacity for growth.</p>
            <p><strong>When?</strong><br>This quote reflects Angelou's personal philosophy, shaped by her experiences with adversity and triumph throughout her life. It resonates particularly during moments of struggle, serving as a reminder that hardships are opportunities for personal growth and self-realization.</p>
            <p><strong>What does it mean?</strong><br>The quote highlights two essential perspectives when facing challenges: the "defeated" perspective, where one views challenges as insurmountable and allows them to define their limitations, and the "resilient" perspective, where one sees challenges as opportunities for growth, strength, and self-discovery. Angelou's message is clear: defeat is not permanent unless we allow it to be. Instead of surrendering to hardship, we should embrace it as a teacher that helps us discover our inner power and ability to persevere. By rising from defeat, we discover who we are and the depth of our strength.</p>
