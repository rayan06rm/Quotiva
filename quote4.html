            <h2>Understanding the Quote</h2>
            <p><strong>Why did he write this?</strong><br>Milne wrote this quote as a message of encouragement, particularly for children, but its meaning applies to people of all ages. Through Winnie the Pooh, he aimed to teach lessons of resilience, self-belief, and the importance of recognizing one's own potential, even when self-doubt arises.</p>
            <p><strong>When?</strong><br>This quote is from Winnie the Pooh, written in the 1920s. Milne’s works were meant to comfort and inspire young readers, but the wisdom in his words continues to resonate with people facing challenges in life, reminding them of their hidden strength.</p>
            <p><strong>What does it mean?</strong><br>The quote is a reminder that we often underestimate ourselves. <ul><li><strong>Bravery:</strong> You have more courage than you think, even in difficult situations.</li><li><strong>Strength:</strong> You are capable of overcoming more than you realize.</li><li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> You are smarter than you give yourself credit for.</li></ul>Milne’s message encourages us to push past self-doubt and trust in our abilities. Often, our fears and insecurities make us feel weaker than we actually are, but if we believe in ourselves, we can accomplish far more than we expect.</p>
